	<h3>Basic tips</h3>
		<ol>
			<li> <b>Call mine, even when it seems obvious.</b> <p>One of the first things you learn in grade school volleyball is to call mine when you're in position to take the ball. As you play in higher levels of volleyball, this becomes engrained, and you automatically call mine, even when it seems pretty obvious.

				For newer players, this instinct isn't as natural. If the ball is coming to you, of course you're going to get it! However, for some players, if they don't hear someone calling “mine”, they may assume that the ball is still 'nobodys' – and someone needs to get it!
				
				Calling “mine” might seem silly, but after you've played in a few games, you'll realize how common it actually is. So don't be afraid to speak up and call for that ball!</p></li>
			<li><b>Try to use all three hits</b><p>In volleyball, each team gets to touch the ball three times before they have to send it back over the net. (Well, technically, they get 4 hits, if one of those touches was a block.) Regardless, sometimes more inexperienced players might get nervous or intimidated by the ball and send the ball over the net before their team has maximized their 3 hits.</p></li>
			<li><b>Don't touch the second ball – unless the setter can't make it</b><p>While we're on the topic of three touches, it's a good time to remind players to let the setter take that second ball. The setter is a specialized position that takes the second ball and sets up the hitters.

				Sometimes that first bump can be off-target from where it's supposed to go, and the setter has to run it down. And sometimes, that ball might be headed right towards one of the other players. While it might be tempting to just set the ball, the setter is the specialized player whose role it is to setup the hitters.</p></li>
			<li><b>Don't set the ball too close to the net</b><p>If the setter calls help and a non-setter player ends up having to set the ball, one of the most common errors they make is to set the ball too close to the net. This means that the hitter doesn't get to use their full hitting approach, and their hitting options are more limited.</p></li>
			<li><b>Don't land on or under the net</b><p>As a newer player, you may not be getting as many sets, so it's really tempting to hit as many spikes as you can. This is a great attitude, however, make sure you maintain a controlled hitting approach, and good spatial awareness of the net, including the area under the net.</p></li>
			<li><b>Don't pass the ball too close to the net</b><p>Another classic error is to pass (or bump) the ball too close to the net. This is sometimes referred to as an over bump. An over bump makes it really difficult for the setter to be able to set the ball – and even if they can salvage it to get a set, chances are they won't be able to run any plays.</p></li>
			<li><b>Don't catch the ball during a play</b><p>It may sound fairly easy but it really does happen quite frequently to be honest.</p></li>
			<li><b>Always be prepared for possible casualities</b><p> Always bring all the equipment you're going to need – and maybe even some extra</p></li>
			<li><b>Don't just jump straight up when blocking</b><p>Many people think that when you're blocking a spike, you just put your arms in the air and jump straight up. What you actually want to do is press your hands forward at the peak of your jump, as if you'repushing against the volleyball as it's being spiked. 
				This push will actually give you a much stronger block and should prevent the momentum of the ball from just pushing right through your hands.
				Just make sure that you're jumping high enough over the net, so that you're pushing above the height of the net and not touching the net at all – otherwise you might be at risk of getting a net violation call.</p></li>
